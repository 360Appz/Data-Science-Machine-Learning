# Summary/Business Problem
Weather forecast is an important aspect of everyday life. At a macro/institutional level, forecasting helps to predict future climate expectations that may affect the area or country. At a micro level, weather affects the everyday person, forecasting helps people to plan their activities which may be affected by weather conditions. In this project, the dataset consisting of Australian cities is used, specifically, Melbourne is chosen as the main city for weather forecast.

# Method
1. Install and import packages (Prophet, Pandas, Matplotlib, os)
2. Import and read dataset
3. Data Pre-processing/Preparation ( Identify locations & data tyoes, conversion of data types, drop irrelevant columns, remove missing data)
4. Training of machine learning model (Prophet)
5. Data visualization and results

# Analysis
# Result
![](https://github.com/360Appz/Data-Science-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Monterey/Images/1%20resize.png) <br> Temperature is higher during year end while temperatures are lower during the early-mid of the yeat { padding-top:5px }
